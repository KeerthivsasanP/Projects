	<b>What is cattlesales</b><br>
	Cattlesales is a website that offers buyers one central site to source cattle in Australia and offers sellers an advertising platform to market their cattle for sale whilst offering a suite of marketing tools.<br><br>
	<b>How is Cattlesales different to existing platforms?</b><br>
	We offer one site that solely caters for sourcing and marketing cattle rather than all types of livestock. Cattlesales also encompasses the entire Indian cattle industry and supports all existing sale points and frameworks for buying and selling cattle. Listings are instantly live as soon as they are placed. Cattlesales offer a range of marketing tools and user features that are not available on any other platform in India and have been custom designed to support livestock agents marketing sale cattle.<br><br>
	<b>Can I place a listing myself or do I require a livestock agent?</b><br>
	Cattlesales is not restricted to use by livestock agents to enable producers and studs to also market sale cattle (even if being sold through an agent), stud bulls and bull sales and genetic products. This also enables producers to place Wanted listings for cattle required. If you choose to sell your cattle without retaining a livestock agent we suggest you seek legal advice in relation the transaction to ensure your rights are protected in the event a buyer does not fulfill payment of the transaction. Cattlesales is not liable for any loss or damage sustained as a result of a failed purchase completion due to non-payment or any other cause. Any seller who chooses to market cattle on our website platform does so at their own risk.<br><br>

	<b>Does Cattlesales receive commission or a benefit from the sale of cattle marketed on the website?</b><br>

	No, we simply provide an advertising and marketing platform.<br><br>
